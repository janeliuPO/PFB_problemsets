Greg by Shel Silverstein

Greg loves me,
Greg cares,
Greg picks me peaches and pears.
Greg offers me candy and Cokes,
Greg listens and laughs at me jokes.
Greg helps when I get in a fight,
Greg does all my homework at night.
Greg misses me,
Greg cries,
Greg thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Greg is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Greg just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Greg's hand,
In the darkness where Greg usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Greg's gone!
